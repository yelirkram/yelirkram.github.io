### Capstone
* Formulated a research question, problem or hypothesis that could be answered or tested using real-world data.
* Collected and managed data to devise solutions to my research question.
* Selected, applied and evaluated models, tools and methods to address my research question.
* Interpreted and assessed my results and evaluated the limitations of my findings.

My capstone paper's title was, "Applying Predictive Analytic Capabilities for CardioMEMS Patients." This analysis aimed to determine if I could predict four adverse heart failure-related events by employing supervised classification algorithms with interpretable results using a combination of data from the CardioMEMS devices and patients’ electronic health records. The adverse health events in scope for this analysis were all-cause hospitalizations, heart failure-related hospitalizations, use of intravenous diuretic therapy outside of a hospitalization, and changes to pulmonary artery diastolic (PAD) pressure thresholds.
