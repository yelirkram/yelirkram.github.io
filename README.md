This analysis aimed to determine if I could predict four adverse heart failure-related events by employing supervised classification algorithms with interpretable results using a combination of data from the CardioMEMS devices and patients’ electronic health records. The adverse health events in scope for this analysis were all-cause hospitalizations, heart failure-related hospitalizations, use of intravenous diuretic therapy outside of a hospitalization, and changes to pulmonary artery diastolic (PAD) pressure thresholds.
