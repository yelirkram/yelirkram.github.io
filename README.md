# Mark E. Riley, PMP
I have 20 years of management and technology consulting experience, primarily in the healthcare provider industry. My experience has included strategic planning, technology roadmap development, software evaluation and selection, software system implementation planning, software system implementation, IT governance, program and project management, data migration, data archiving, database design and development, custom software design development, and the software development life cycle (SDLC). I am certified Project Management Professional (PMP) from Project Management International (PMI).

I am seeking a full-time job in the DC-metro area using my master's degree in data science and extensive healthcare technology management consulting career. I would prefer to work locally with up to 10% travel.

## Data Science Coursework
* [DS 700: Foundations of Data Science](#ds-700-foundations-of-data-science)
* [DS 705: Statistical Methods](#ds-705-statistical-methods)
* [DS 710: Programming for Data Science](#ds-710-programming-for-data-science)

### DS 700 Foundations of Data Science
* Defined data science and explain its role in decision making.
* Described database technologies and their strengths and weaknesses.
* Created and managed simple databases in SQL Server.
* Wrote and executed SQL statements to retrieve and manage data.
* Explained key statistical concepts that built a foundation for advanced courses in the program.
* Analyzed data to solve basic analytics problems using Excel and R.
* Explained best practices that improve the effectiveness of data science projects and mitigate risks associated with such projects.

**Final Project - Fargo Health Group Forecasting**
My final project for this course was to apply the data science skills acquired in this class using the *Harvard Business Review* case study, "Fargo Health Group: Managing the Demand for Medical Examinations Using Predictive Analytics," to perform clean up the datasets, perform analysis, and generate a recommended course of action as a consultant to the Fargo Health Group.

### DS 705 Statistical Methods
* Examined and summarize data numerically and graphically.
* Given a data set and a question, chose the appropriate statistical procedure.
* Verified conditions for statistical procedures.
* Performed hypothesis tests and compute confidence intervals.
* Explored and modeled relationships among variables and used models to make predictions.
* Used software package R to implement statistical analyses.
* Interpreted and critically evaluated statistical information and data-based arguments.
* Effectively communicated the results of statistical analysis.
* Used R Markdown to produce statistical reports and supported reproducible research.

**Final Project - Bank Loan Approval Optimization Report**
I developed a report for a bank with recommendations on using logistic regression to maximize the accuracy of approved loans and maximize bank profit. Tasks included data cleanup, data exploration, feature engineering, imputing missing data, model development, model optimization for dual goals, and summary report with recommendations.

### DS 710 Programming for Data Science
* Used Python and R to analyze real-world data.
* Used Git for professional version control.
* Used Python data structures to organize both numerical and text-based data.
* Performed exploratory data analysis in R.
* Tested statistical hypotheses using R functions.
* Used an application programming interface (API) to collect real-world data from social media.
* Cleaned and formated data for analysis.
* Chose and implemented efficient methods for analyzing data sets.
* Followed best practices for documentation and readable code.

**Final Project - Analysis of Tesla Autonomy Day Tweets Sentiment**
The final project was an opportunity to apply what I had learned to answer a question that interested me by collecting and analyzing real-world data from Twitter. I chose to analyize the sentiment of tweets related to the “Tesla Autonomy Investor Day” event on April 22, 2019. Deliverables included.
